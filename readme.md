Adventure Quest 3000
=====================

Premise
-------
I started programming when I was in the sixth grade.  As a college senior, preparing to graduate with a degree in Computer Science, it occurred to me that the middle school class that got me started was one of the most influential moments of my life.  I decided that I needed (and wanted) to pay my knowledge forward, so I started teaching classes at the Florence-Lauderdale Public Library.  Classes are free and open to all ages, and will continue for as long as I remain in Florence.

Adventure Quest
---------------
Adventure Quest 3000 is a simple, text-based RPG.  It's nothing more than a fun way to illustrate basic programming concepts to our students.  Feel free to take, modify, and play with the code.
